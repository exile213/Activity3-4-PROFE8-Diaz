# Video Assets - MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS

## For Tasks 10-11 (Video Player) - OPTIONAL:

### Only 1 file needed (optional):

- `video1.mp4` - Any MP4 video file

**That's it! Just 1 video file, and it's optional.**

## How it works:

- App already uses online sample videos (BigBuckBunny, etc.)
- Works perfectly without any local video files
- Local videos are just an alternative source
- You can use any MP4 file and rename it to `video1.mp4`

## Current Status:

- Video player implemented with online fallbacks
- No local video files required for app to function
- Online videos work out of the box

## Video Requirements:

- Format: MP4
- Any length or content
- Resolution: 720p or 1080p
- Professional drone operation content
- Clear audio for demonstration purposes

## Alternative Options:

- Can use sample videos from Flutter community
- Can implement with placeholder content initially
- Network video URLs can be used for testing
