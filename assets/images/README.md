# Images Assets - MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS

## For Activity 5 Implementation (REDUCED):

### Essential Images (only 3 total needed):

- `drone1.jpg` - Any drone image (used for equipment, fleet, and demos)
- `pilot1.jpg` - Any person photo (for pilot profiles)
- `project1.jpg` - Any landscape/building photo (for project demos)

**That's it! Just 3 images total.**

## How it works:

- The same `drone1.jpg` will be reused everywhere (equipment page, fleet page, etc.)
- The same `pilot1.jpg` will be reused for all pilot profiles
- The same `project1.jpg` will be reused for all project demonstrations
- App includes fallback placeholders if images are missing

## Current Status:

- All code is implemented with proper error handling
- Works without any images (shows placeholder icons)
- Add the 3 images above for the complete experience

## Image Requirements:

- Format: JPG/PNG
- Any size (app will resize automatically)
- Any content (doesn't have to be drone-related)
