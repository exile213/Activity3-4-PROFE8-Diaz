# Audio Assets - MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS

## For Task 12 (Audio Feedback) - OPTIONAL:

### Only 1 file needed (optional):

- `booking_success.mp3` - Any short sound file (notification, beep, etc.)

**That's it! Just 1 audio file, and it's optional.**

## How it works:

- App includes full error handling for missing audio
- Works perfectly without any audio files
- Audio is just a nice bonus feature
- You can use any MP3 file and rename it to `booking_success.mp3`

## Current Status:

- AudioService implemented with graceful fallbacks
- No audio files required for app to function
- Add the 1 MP3 file above for sound effects

## Audio Requirements:

- Format: MP3
- Any length (preferably under 3 seconds)
- Any sound content
